# SWAPI

This uses React Native with the Star Wars API (SWAPI), as of 12/3/19 it is not working, may return at a later date to figure out why.

`App.js` provides the store and dispatches it to `getPeople` (From `./components/data/api/characters.js`) to then move into `./components/main.js` but as of current it is not working properly.
